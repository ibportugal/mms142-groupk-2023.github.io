            <p class="p-heading">We are constantly bombarded with the latest advancements in technology, with each new one promising to solve this or that problem, or aiming to be the most powerful tool available in the market. Then there are technologies that aim to lower the barriers to creating functionalities and applications, simplifying the process such that people with little or no programming experience can create custom software applications.</p>
            <p class="separator">Such tools and platforms are called low-code and no-code (LCNC) technologies. These technologies have emerged in recent years and grown in popularity as users - whether you’re a complete beginner or seasoned developer - do not need to create from scratch. People of different skill levels and professional backgrounds can use LCNC to bring their ideas to life - whether it’s a student creating a mobile app for a project, an entrepreneur who wants to automate repetitive tasks, or an organization tinkering around during the initial stages of product development but trying to keep costs low.</p>
            <p class="separator">In 2022, technological research and consulting firm Gartner forecasted the worldwide market for LCNC to grow 20% in 2023. Gartner stated in a December 2022 press release that “a rise in business technologists and a growing number of enterprise-wide hyperautomation and composable business initiatives will be the key drivers accelerating the adoption of low-code technologies through 2026.”</p>
            <p class="separator">While it has been asked what kind of disruption LCNC would cause to tech development (developers, programmers), pundits have voiced out that developers would never be out of work and that there are plenty of jobs to go around. This is because while more people will be interacting with tech through the LCNC tools and platforms, accessibility is not the same as context or security or scalability. In a blog post, Stack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar was quoted as saying that while “there are lots of benefits to low-code platforms…the need for context will undoubtedly remain consistent.”</p>

            <span>Accessible and Convenient</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>PROS:</b> Since it does not require in-depth knowledge about coding, Low-code and No-code "limits the barrier to 
		    entry for software creation" (Northwest Executive Education, 2023). It offers a wider accessibility for contributors.
		    Someone can create a mobile application without hiring a development team; an amateur developer can produce an 
		    enterprise-level application or code effectively. Low-code and no-code are accessible and convenient to use even to 
		    inexperienced and non-developers.</p>

          </div>

            <span>Promotes Collaboration</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>PROS:</b> Low-code and no-code platforms open avenues for collaboration for both kinds of users, given its 
		    accesibility to both experienced and non-experienced developers and technical and non-technical teams</p><br><br>
	    <p class="separator">This allows team members with different skill sets to collaborate without needing to be coding-savvy. 
		    Appian described low-code and no-code platforms as a well-organized toolbox, helping an enterprise's development 
		    team to collaborate, "ensuring that changes are organized, tracked, and understood".</p>

            <span>Cost-Saving</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>PROS:</b> Northwest Executive Education (2023) states that low-code and no-code platforms offer reduced errors 
		    and less limited options for who can contribute. The same article further discussed that enterprises could save 
		    time and resources by minimizing error fixes and reducing the need for hiring skillful and experienced developers.
		    Thus, adopting low-code and no-code solutions could significantly lower the overall cost in the long run. </p>

            <i class="ion-social-android-outline"></i>
            <span>Faster Integration</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>PROS:</b> Since Low-code and no-code provide pre-built templates and drag-and-drop reusable components, it requires 
		    less time in coding and, as mentioned earlier, in fixing errors. It also reduces the time needed to connect with 
		    databases. One of the blogs from Appian even exclaimed that Low-code and No-code platforms "dramatically accelerate 
		    development" and claimed that time is no longer a barrier to productivity. A study conducted 
		    by McKinsey & Company (2022) disclosed that low-code and no-code technologies have the potential to accelerate 
		    development time by 90%. After all, the features of low-code and no-code platforms such as pre-built 
		    templates, drag-and-drop components, query builders, etc. are designed to speed up the development and launch of 
		    products.</p>

            <span>Increased Productivity</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>PROS:</b> The existence of pre-built templates and drag-and-drop interfaces in low-code and no-code platforms 
		    save users from repetitive and mundane tasks. This allows developers to focus on value-added and complex tasks,
		    resulting in increased productivity and efficiency.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="services-block">

            <i class="ion-ios-camera-outline"></i>
            <span>Declining Design Innovation</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>CONS:</b> The prebuilt templates and drag-and-drop component features of low-code and no-code software dwindle 
		    design creativity. Since there are pre-built templates, variations in creative designs and elements are getting fewer.
		    In fact, Abdallat (cited in Forbes, 2023) shared that the pervasiveness of the prebuilt templates,
		    "has come to the point that you can tell what exact template was used just by looking at a website".
		    It seems as if our creative limits are not getting pushed or challenged with low-code and no-code platforms.</p>

	  <div class="services-block">

            <i class="ion-ios-camera-outline"></i>
            <span>Limited Customization</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>CONS:</b> Another issue the low-code and no-code face because of its convenient features is the limitations
		    when it comes to advanced customization. Though there is no longer a barrier to productivity, as claimed by Appian,
		    Northwest Education states that low-code and no-code platforms put a barrier to implementing complex design
		    requirements. The same article exemplified an enterprise that does not find low-code and no-code platforms flexible,
		    as it might not be able to build a "highly specialized accounting software tailored to their industry-specific needs".
		    Although Low-code and no-code are cost-saving and accessible, they might limit what users can create.</p>

            <span>Possible Learning Curve</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>CONS:</b> The inherent properties of low-code and no-code platforms, being accessible and convenient even
		    to non-technical users, is precisely what lays the foundation for the potential learning curve. Northwest Executive
		    Education (2023) believess that learning curve coould still be anticipated, despite the low-code nd no-code platform
		    does not require in-depth nowledge about coding, as it could be linked to mastering the distinct features and
		    workflows of the platform.</p>

            <span>Inadequate Security</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>CONS:</b> Having pre-built features in low-code and no-code may inadvertently introduce errors and
		    security threats. Forbes (2023) emphasized that these tools can make the users complacent, tempting them to overlook
		    important safeguarding procedures. Additionally, individuals constructing apps through low-code and no-code might
		    lack the necessary security expertise and practical knowledge to ensure their app's security.</p>

          </div>

	  <div class="services-block">

            <i class="ion-ios-camera-outline"></i>
            <span>Vendor Lock-in</span>
            <p class="separator"><b>CONS:</b> Vendor lock-in refers to a situation where a customer becomes dependent on the vendor to the point
		    of being stuck, as switching to another vendor is too risky and costly. In the context of using LCNC platforms,
		    users may experience vendor lock-in, relying heavily on a specific low-code or no-code platform, and switching to
		    another platform might cause rewriting of the whole process and application. Forbes (2023) describes vendor lock-in
		    as the "main downside" in using low-code and no-code platforms.</p>

            <p class="p-heading">Evidently, there is a persistent rise of the Low-Code and No-Code (LCNC) approach to software development, and it can be attributed to the increased need to 
		    rapidly develop applications and digitise processes. In a world where competition is stiff, the desire to create an application or automate a task is heightened, 
		    and so one would resort to an approach that promotes accessibility and convenience, collaboration, cost savings, integration efficiency, increased productivity, 
		    and diminished dependence on highly specialized developers, among others. These given characteristics are the beneficial qualities of LCNC platforms.</p>
            <p class="separator">Surely, LCNC technologies have their share of drawbacks - declining design innovation, limited customization, inadequate security, and vendor lock-in 
		    to name a few. Technology pervasiveness demand simpler ways of developing software applications which is why these disadvantages may be considered as minor and 
		    can be dealt with via some available workarounds.</p>
            <p class="separator">Overall, LCNC is undoubtedly a game-changer, what with the bright future it contributes in this day and age of digital transformation.</p>
