## Introduction
  ### Background and Definition
  We are constantly bombarded with the latest advancements in technology, with each new one promising to solve this or that problem, or aiming to be the most powerful tool available in the market. Then there are technologies that aim to lower the barriers to creating functionalities and applications, simplifying the process such that people with little or no programming experience can create custom software applications. 

  Such tools and platforms are called low-code and no-code (LCNC) technologies. These technologies have emerged in recent years and grown in popularity as users - whether you’re a complete beginner or seasoned developer - do not need to create from scratch. People of different skill levels and professional backgrounds can use LCNC to bring their ideas to life - whether it’s a student creating a mobile app for a project, an entrepreneur who wants to automate repetitive tasks, or an organization tinkering around during the initial stages of product development but trying to keep costs low.

  In 2022, technological research and consulting firm Gartner forecasted the worldwide market for LCNC to grow 20% in 2023. Gartner stated in a December 2022 press release that “a rise in business technologists and a growing number of enterprise-wide hyperautomation and composable business initiatives will be the key drivers accelerating the adoption of low-code technologies through 2026.”

While it has been asked what kind of disruption LCNC would cause to tech development (developers, programmers), pundits have voiced out that developers would never be out of work and that there are plenty of jobs to go around. This is because while more people will be interacting with tech through the LCNC tools and platforms, accessibility is not the same as context or security or scalability. In a blog post, Stack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar was quoted as saying that while “_there are lots of benefits to low-code platforms…the need for context will undoubtedly remain consistent._”


  ### How do Low-Code and No-Code (LCNC) Technologies Perform Alongside their Differences?
  In the realm of programming, developers must deeply comprehend the complexities of high language codes that a computer or system can respond or can make function based on our desired vision in creating application softwares or websites. One's accumulated experience of the different computer languages does not suffice, because such projects have to undergo deployment and testing procedures to certify its functionality. This evokes to the rationale that not every individual has highly proficient skills when it comes to coding. As modern technologies constantly proliferate, low-code and no-code technologies are included in the first rapid application development (RAD) tools, which later evolved with the objective of trying to eliminate long labor hours in producing applications or websites. 
 
Indeed, LCNC technologies alleviate the requirements of traditional coding to high programming languages. According to Pratt (2021), the process of utilizing LCNC technologies are similar into formulating a flowchart instead of entering a series of codes providing  specific functions or commands. In elaboration, LCNC modalities feature flexibility or scalability, pre-programmed templates, drag-and-drop, point-and-click models, cross-platform accessibility, and security. Both formats assist users to customize their projects that are ideal for experimentation, prototyping, and rapid development. 

In 2024, SAP (n.d.) reported their latest Gartner survey that around 65% of application developments are created through LCNC platforms with every two-year projected growth rate of 165%. This signifies that people who utilize such alternative materials like LCNC appreciate the probable merits of generating project developments in any fields of business industries. Given this instance, LCNC platforms allow users or development teams to apply them on supply chains, manufacturing, accounting and finance, IT departments, human resources, and process automation. Undoubtedly, the proliferation of application of LCNC technologies also gathers a new count of “citizen developers”. Knowing that the Information Age has transformed its trends, issues, and demands, especially on expecting every individual living in modern generation to be media and information literate. Thus, it evolves and emerges the existence of **citizen developers**, which emphasizes that an individual does not necessarily have to be competent in computer languages. Also, this addresses the extreme demand of experts in coding and making it inclusive to any IT workloads within small businesses and enterprises. Moreso, LCNC platforms have been on their way to empower the so-called non-It specialists or professionals to further understand and collaborate by establishing processes, workspace, and appropriate technologies when creating applications and developing websites. 

At this point, one might ask what makes low-code and no-code distinct from one another? Both platforms are definitely ideal to non-IT professionals who are in need of digital skills for personal and business-related matters. In fact, no-code (NC) programs are suitable enough for total beginners, where people can create applications by dominantly utilizing drag-and-drop features. In any other way, low-code (LC) programs still allow individuals to develop their applications, yet this amplifies more automation in terms of projct customization through the ingestion of minimal coding commands to address some significant enterprise requirements.

Overall, it can be denoted that no-code (NC) is purely visual and less time-consuming, while low-code (LC) is linked visual and coding with increased development time process as a differentiation to one another (Arkhipov, 2022).

  ### Benefits and Shortcomings
   #### Benefits

**Accessible and Convenient**

Since it does not require in-depth knowledge about coding, Low-code and No-code "_limits the barrier to entry for software creation_" (Northwest Executive Education, 2023). It offers a wider accessibility for contributors. Someone can create a mobile application without hiring a development team; an amateur developer can produce an enterprise-level application or code effectively. Low-code and no-code are accessible and convenient to use even to inexperienced and non-developers.

**Promotes Collaboration**

Low-code and no-code platforms open avenues for collaboration for both kinds of users, given its accesibility to both experienced and non-experienced developers and technical and non-technical teams

This allows team members with different skill sets to collaborate without needing to be coding-savvy. Appian described low-code and no-code platforms as a well-organized toolbox, helping an enterprise's development team to collaborate, "ensuring that changes are organized, tracked, and understood".

**Cost-Saving**

Northwest Executive Education (2023) states that low-code and no-code platforms offer reduced errors and less limited options for who can contribute. The same article further discussed that enterprises could save time and resources by minimizing error fixes and reducing the need for hiring skillful and experienced developers. Thus, adopting low-code and no-code solutions could significantly lower the overall cost in the long run. 

**Faster Integration**

Since Low-code and no-code provide pre-built templates and drag-and-drop reusable components, it requires less time in coding and, as mentioned earlier, in fixing errors. It also reduces the time needed to connect with databases. One of the blogs from Appian even exclaimed that Low-code and No-code platforms "_dramatically accelerate development_" and claimed that time is no longer a barrier to productivity. A study conducted by McKinsey & Company (2022) disclosed that low-code and no-code technologies have the potential to accelerate development time by 90%. After all, the features of low-code and no-code platforms such as pre-built templates, drag-and-drop components, query builders, etc. are designed to speed up the development and launch of products. 

**Increased Productivity**

The existence of pre-built templates and drag-and-drop interfaces in low-code and no-code platforms save users from repetitive and mundane tasks. This allows developers to focus on value-added and complex tasks, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency. 

#### Shortcomings

**Declining Design Innovation**

The prebuilt templates and drag-and-drop component features of low-code and no-code software dwindle design creativity. Since there are pre-built templates, variations in creative designs and elements are getting fewer. In fact, Abdallat (cited in Forbes, 2023) shared that the pervasiveness of the prebuilt templates, "_has come to the point that you can tell what exact template was used just by looking at a website_". It seems as if our creative limits are not getting pushed or challenged with low-code and no-code platforms.

**Limited Customization**

Another issue the low-code and no-code face because of its convenient features is the limitations when it comes to advanced customization. Though there is no longer a barrier to productivity, as claimed by Appian, Northwest Education states that low-code and no-code platforms put a barrier to implementing complex design requirements. The same article exemplified an enterprise that does not find low-code and no-code platforms flexible, as it might not be able to build a "highly specialized accounting software tailored to their industry-specific needs". Although Low-code and no-code are cost-saving and accessible, they might limit what users can create.

**Possible Learning Curve**

The inherent properties of low-code and no-code platforms, being accessible and convenient even to non-technical users, is precisely what lays the foundation for the potential learning curve. Northwest Executive Education (2023) believess that learning curve coould still be anticipated, despite the low-code nd no-code platform does not require in-depth nowledge about coding, as it could be linked to mastering the distinct features and workflows of the platform. 

**Inadequate Security**

Having pre-built features in low-code and no-code may inadvertently introduce errors and security threats. Forbes (2023) emphasized that these tools can make the users complacent, tempting them to overlook important safeguarding procedures. Additionally, individuals constructing apps through low-code and no-code might lack the necessary security expertise and practical knowledge to ensure their app's security. 

**Vendor Lock-in**

Vendor lock-in refers to a situation where a customer becomes dependent on the vendor to the point of being stuck, as switching to another vendor is too risky and costly. In the context of using LCNC platforms, users may experience vendor lock-in, relying heavily on a specific low-code or no-code platform, and switching to another platform might cause rewriting of the whole process and application. Forbes (2023) describes vendor lock-in as the "main downside" in using low-code and no-code platforms.

  ### Examples of Low Code and No Code Technologies

  #### Bubble (Bubble.io) 
  **Bubble** is a no-code development platform that specializes in creating robust web and mobile apps (Bubble, n.d.). It is commonly marketed towards individuals who want to build software despite having limited or no programming expertise. Despite this focus, Bubble features a plugin ecosystem and a no-code application programming interface (API) connector for those who want to extend its capabilities, making it a tool that even experienced programmers can still utilize. As a visual programming language, Bubble aims to help users in software development through the use of graphics and images instead of the traditional text-based coding.

  Aside from being extensible, Bubble also offers the following features:
  - **Customizable:** Users can achieve any user interface and user experience (UI/UX) design by customizing the different tools available on the Bubble platform 
  - **Deployment and Hosting:** Bubble manages the server setup, software installation, and monitoring
  - **Full-stack:** Bubble covers all the essential components an app needs to be fully functional: user interface (front-end) design, back-end logic, and hosting environment (LowCode Agency, 2023).

  According to Airdev (n.d.), there are three basic steps in creating an app with Bubble. The first step is design, which commonly involves the drag-and-drop editor that can be used to arrange the app’s visual elements. The second step is creating the database and the last step is writing the workflows, which is essential for assigning reactions to certain actions done within the app. After finishing these steps, Bubble then translates the user’s editor setup into code that browsers can interpret, namely HTML and Javascript.
  With 3.3 million apps built on Bubble, this no-code development platform has successfully helped many creators, founders, and business owners to build and deploy innovative apps without requiring proper programming expertise.

  #### Salesforce Lightning
  Launched by Salesforce, a renowned provider of customer relationship management (CRM) software, **Salesforce Lightning** is a low-code platform for building applications focused on addressing business needs and CRM. It is meant to democratize the app-building process for business organizations by making it accessible, easier, and faster without sacrificing effectiveness and innovation (Lee, 2018). This is partly because designing applications in this platform is based on metadata instead of traditional hardcoding. The platform has all the features that most low-code app-building platforms have - extensive access controls, code blocks that can be dragged and dropped, comprehensive design templates and hosting options, compatibility with multiple devices, as well as advanced customization and automation capabilities. But what makes Salesforce Lightning appealing to business enterprises is that unique features can be tailored and offered based on both the business administrator's and developer's needs. 

These are some of the features embedded within the platform to make such claims possible:
- **Einstein Automate**: Enables businesses to create workflows, automate business processes through bots, and sift data to generate forecasts for maximum efficiency, just by clicking (no coding at all).
- **Customer Identity Plus**: Provides simplified user identity management by adding an identity layer across different channels to eliminate the need for separate logins in each digital touchpoint, which is incredibly useful if a company has an active large user base. This is also reinforced by a single command-line interface for various platforms with **CLI Unification**. 
- **DevOps Center**: A unified software development and operations hub for enhanced collaboration and faster development-release cycles.
  
The versatility of Salesforce Lightning in enabling businesses ranges from self-service shopping portals, creating specialized inventory management systems that can be integrated with existing CRMs, a centralized platform for all relevant employees to handle complex management of Wi-Fi locks across multiple establishments for enhanced operations and customer satisfaction, sales and marketing resources, to employee web-based portals for HR needs. However, Salesforce Lightning's high-empowered features through low-code technology also have drawbacks such as the need for regular regression testing, potential customization conflicts, and making the most out of this platform may still be too intricate without a developer's knowledge. (Nguyen, n.d.)

  #### Mendix
  **Mendix** is a low-code application development platform that was founded in the Netherlands by three entrepreneurs who wanted to find a quicker and more efficient way to create internal software applications (Battery Ventures, 2022). With a user-friendly visual interface that helps inexperienced users build and deploy custom software, Mendix stays true to its goal of assisting businesses by minimizing time and costs compared to traditional software development. 

  Some of the features that make Mendix stand out from other low-code development platforms are their integration of AI, cloud services, and a well-managed support system (Mendix, 2023). 

  - **Cloud:** All Mendix apps are designed to work seamlessly in the cloud, making them easy to move and use wherever needed, simultaneously fostering flexibility in terms of deployment, maintenance, and compatibility across different cloud service providers.

The first is the Mendix Forum, where users may ask questions, give answers, and find the resources they need to achieve their software development goals. The second section is the Mendix Marketplace, which provides solutions built by Mendix and Mendix partners that users can use to extend the capabilities of their software. Lastly, the Mendix Academy, wherein training courses and workshops related to low-code software development are available for those who are interested in learning more. 

  These unique features make Mendix a versatile low-code development platform that guides organizations in creating powerful applications regardless of their programming experience. As stated by Siemens Software (n.d.), this grants users the power to speed up the whole process of software development while also promoting collaboration within their organization.

 
## Disruptive Technologies

   ### Closing The Gap (Article Title)

Low-code and No-code development platforms have been transformative for startups and businesses, primarily due to their ability to significantly reduce the costs associated with traditional software development. One discernable disruption in particular can be observed in an organizational setting via Enterprise Applications. The use of low-code and no-code platforms presents several advantages in the realm of software development. One major benefit is the diminished dependence on highly specialized developers, which is customary in traditional software development. This reliance often incurs substantial costs, particularly burdensome for startups grappling with limited financial resources. These platforms democratize application creation by offering intuitive interfaces and pre-built modules, empowering individuals with varying technical expertise, including non-developers, to craft applications. This not only significantly reduces the necessity for a team of elite developers but also curtails hiring expenses.

Moreover, these platforms expedite the development process through an assortment of templates, pre-built components, and drag-and-drop functionalities. Consequently, the time invested in application development substantially decreases compared to conventional coding methods. This acceleration in the development cycle enables businesses to swiftly introduce their products or solutions to the market. This not only trims development costs but also positions startups to swiftly seize market opportunities.The implementation of low-code and no-code platforms translates to reduced maintenance and training costs. These platforms typically integrate built-in maintenance features and updates managed by the platform provider, eliminating the need for a dedicated maintenance team and thereby lessening ongoing operational expenses. Additionally, their user-friendly design minimizes the training necessary for individuals to commence application building, thus diminishing training expenses inherent in traditional coding languages and frameworks.

Scalability and flexibility are additional perks offered by these platforms. Many of them provide scalable solutions, allowing businesses to expand without incurring exorbitant additional costs. As the business scales, these platforms adeptly accommodate heightened demands without necessitating a complete overhaul of the infrastructure or applications, thus mitigating scalability costs.Moreover, the utilization of low-code and no-code platforms optimizes resources and bolsters overall cost efficiency. By facilitating rapid prototyping and iterative development, these platforms enable early identification and rectification of issues in the developmental phase. This early intervention significantly reduces the costs associated with fixing errors or implementing changes later in the development cycle, thereby optimizing resources and enhancing cost efficiency (Carroll et al., 2021).

	
#### Pre-Low Code/No Code Adoption:

1. **Development Costs** - Traditional enterprise application development involves high costs due to the need for skilled developers, extensive coding, and longer development cycles. Companies had to invest significantly in hiring specialized talent.

2. **Time Consumption** - The development process was time-consuming, leading to extended project timelines. Businesses often face delays due to the complexities involved in coding and debugging.

3. **Maintenance Expenses** - Post-development, ongoing maintenance, and updates were substantial cost centers. As technologies evolved, keeping applications up-to-date incurred additional expenses.

4. **Training and Support** - Employees needed training to operate these applications, adding to the overall expenditure. Additionally, ongoing support was required for troubleshooting and bug fixing.	

#### Post-Low Code/No Code Adoption:

1. **Reduced Development Costs** - Low code and no code platforms significantly cut down on development costs as they empower users with minimal coding skills to create applications. Companies can utilize existing in-house talent for application development, reducing the need for specialized hires.
  
2. **Accelerated Development** -  These platforms streamline the development process, enabling rapid prototyping and quicker deployment of applications. This acceleration translates to cost savings by reducing man-hours and project duration.
  
3. **Lower Maintenance Expenses** - Low code/no code solutions often come with built-in functionalities, simplifying maintenance and updates. This decreases ongoing costs related to upkeep and ensures compatibility with evolving technologies.
  
4. **Ease of Use and Support** - These platforms often have intuitive interfaces, minimizing the need for extensive training. Additionally, many offer robust support, reducing expenses related to troubleshooting and technical support.


#### Cost Comparison: 

According to a 2023 Forms2 article, traditional development costs range from $40,000 to $100,000 or more. This accounts for the entire project cost as a whole including maintenance, update, training, etc... 

Forms2, a low-code development platform, costs a fraction of these traditional development costs. It ranges from $18-23 per month/$216-300 per year (it operates on a subscription model which varies based on package).

While initial costs might include subscription fees for these platforms, they are generally lower compared to the traditional model where substantial investments in development and hiring were mandatory. Training costs are negligble or minimal due to the nature of its design and purpose while excluding or limiting the requirement of traditional service providers/vendors or in-house developers. The long-term savings are significant as low code/no code platforms reduce dependency on specialized developers, decrease time-to-market, and lower ongoing maintenance expenses. For context, traditional developer costs in the United States range from $69,268 for a junior developer per year to $104,252 for a senior developer per year. This shift has the potential to redirect traditional developers away from primary enterprise development tasks and toward roles focused on updating platforms for vendors. However, it simultaneously creates new opportunities for these developers to concentrate on specialized or higher-value tasks such as architecting complex systems, customizing intricate functionalities, integrating diverse systems, and maintaining or updating the low-code platforms themselves.


  ### Explain the situation and the given topic given its disruptiveness

### AI: A type of technology used highly in the current age. (Article Title)

Have you ever thought of having a machine do your decisions for you in the way you would actually do? Over the rise of current events there have been talks of the uses of AI in businesses, education and in daily decision making use. According to an article by Nicole Laskowski, AI or artificial intelligence is “the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.” In short, it is an imitation of  human consciousness in terms of decision-making in  certain technologies. (Laskowski, 2023)

AI works by storing and processing extremely large amounts of data and using systems to learn from the data it collects. Because AI  is based on  learning from processed data, it still cannot understand emotional thinking in today's world. In modern times, where AI  cannot properly process emotions, technology that utilizes AI in fields that require hospitality will not work, so further development is required. AI is harmless to use in the right hand. AI can actually help predict charts and trends based on previously provided information, helping businesses and the  medical sector to predict and prepare for future causes.
AI can also be used to calculate things, since human error is less likely to occur if  the machine has the right conditions and numbers. 

Examples of AI’s that can be used by the public are ChatGPT and Google Bard. These are AI’s that you can chat with and converse with, and with their knowledge linked with a large database they can help you in your needs. For example Google Bard is equipped with the information that google knows, so it can help you in your quest for knowledge or something else. With this in mind as data continues to be created by the people the database grows and the AI grows more intelligent.

AI can be dangerous if used incorrectly or in  dangerous ways. If AI systems are designed for that purpose, they can be used to hack or infiltrate personal information. In summary, AI is now getting smarter because data is created every day and some AI systems handle more processing every day.This is a very powerful tool that can make a real and lasting difference in the world. Whether AI is good or bad depends on who uses it and how.


## Conclusion (summary, recommendations)

Evidently, there is a persistent rise of the Low-Code and No-Code (LCNC) approach to software development, and it can be attributed to the increased need to rapidly develop applications and digitise processes. In a world where competition is stiff, the desire to create an application or automate a task is heightened, and so one would resort to an approach that promotes accessibility and convenience, collaboration, cost savings, integration efficiency, increased productivity, and diminished dependence on highly specialized developers, among others. These given characteristics are the beneficial qualities of LCNC platforms, which makes it a preferred approach to such endeavors. 

Surely, LCNC technologies have their share of drawbacks - declining design innovation, limited customization, inadequate security, and vendor lock-in to name a few. Technology pervasiveness demand simpler ways of developing software applications which is why these disadvantages may be considered as minor and can be dealt with via some available workarounds.

Overall, LCNC is undoubtedly a game-changer, what with the bright future it contributes in this day and age of digital transformation.
