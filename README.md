## Introduction
  ### Background and Definition

  ### Functionality
  In the realm of programming, developers have to deeply comprehend the complexities of high language codes that a computer or the system can respond or make function to our desired vision to application softwares or websites. More than having experience to computer languages, such projects have to undergo deployment and testing procedures to certify its functionality. This evokes to the rationale that not every professional or individual has high proficient skills when it comes to coding. As modern technologies constantly proliferate, low-code and no-code technologies are included from the first rapid application development (RAD) tools, which later evolved by trying to eliminate much labor hours in producing applications or websites. 
 
Indeed, low-code and no-code technologies alleviates the requirement of traditional coding to high programming languages. According to Pratt (2021), the process of utilizing LCNC are like formulating a flowchart instead of entering a series of codes providing its specific functions or commands. In elaboration, LCNC modalities feature flexibility or scalability, pre-programmed templates, drag-and-drop, point-and-click models, cross-platform accessibility, and security. Both formats assist users to customize their projects that are ideal for experimentation, prototyping, and rapid development. 

In 2024, SAP Build (n.d.) reported their latest Gartner survey that around 65% of application developments are created through LCNC platforms with every two-year projected growth rate of 165%. This signifies that people who utilize such alternative materials like LCNC appreciate the probable merits of generating project developments in any fields of business industries. Given this instance, LCNC platforms allow users or development teams to apply it on supply chains, manufacturing, accounting and finance, IT departments, Human resources, and process automation. Undoubtedly, the proliferation of application of LCNC technologies also accumulate a new count of “citizen developers”. Knowing that the Information has transformed it trends, issues, and demands, especially on expecting every individual living in modern generation to be media and information literate. Thus, it evolves and emerges the existence of “**citizen developers**”, which these people do not necessarily have to be high proficient in computer languages. Also, this addresses the extreme demand of experts in coding and making it inclusive to any IT workloads in business enterprises. Moreso, LCNC platforms have been on its way to empower not-so IT specialists to further understand and collaborate by establishing processes, workspace, and appropriate technologies on creating app and website developments. 

At this point, what makes low-code and no-code distinct to one another? Now, as a slight overview since it will be covered to some portions, both platforms are definitely ideal for non-IT professionals who are in need of digital skills for personal and business-related matters. In fact, no-code (NC) programs are suitable enough for total beginners, where people can create applications by dominantly utilizing drag-and-drop features. Otherwise, low-code (LC) programs still allow individuals to develop their applications, yet this amplifies more automation towards the users on how they customize their projects by adding little coding commands for some significant enterprise requirements. Overall, it can be denoted that no-code is purely visual and less time-consuming, yet low-code is linked visual and coding with increased development time process as a differentiation to one another (Arkhipov, 2022).
